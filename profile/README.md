MathGloss is a project to organize math and turn natural language into a _lingua franca_ for different formal systems.
MathGoss is mostly concerned with  undergraduate mathematics, as taught perhaps in an American university degree in Pure Mathematics. 
MathGloss is built by Lucy Horowitz and Valeria de Paiva. Check out the [abstract](https://europroofnet.github.io/cambridge-2023/#horowitz) of our talk at EuroProofNet workshop in Cambridge from September 2023, and this [writeup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12649)!

We're also developing [CatGloss](https://github.com/MathGloss/CatGloss)
